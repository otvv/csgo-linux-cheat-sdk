# :toolbox: `csgo-linux-cheat-sdk`

I tried to make the cleanest and most capable CS:GO cheating software developement kit for linux. (emphasis on TRIED.)

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">details</summary>

  <li>this sdk is from november 2020</li>
  <li>it has almost everything needed for a full blown internal CS:GO cheat</li>
  <li>it uses FGUI as its GUI framework, feel free to change to w/e you want</li>

**NOTE:** As of today (2023/04/01) the shared-library can be injected just fine.

(even tho you are able to inject/load the sdk without any issues, don't assume that everything is updated and working as intended,<br>
some stuff is clearly outdated _(or not)_ like: `ItemsDefinitionIndex` and `ClassID` enums, some netvars might've changed tables, etc.)
